### TASK-044
**title:** AudioManager init + mute button wiring
**track:** FAST
**status:** IN_PROGRESS
**depends_on:** [TASK-038]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/systems/AudioManager.js, app/ui/hud.js, app/game/scenes/Boot.js, app/index.html]
**writes:** [app/game/systems/AudioManager.js, app/ui/hud.js]
**done_when:**
- `AudioManager.init()` is called on first user interaction event (Tone.start() requirement met)
- Location-specific soundscape starts automatically when player enters each scene (ZONE_ENTER event)
- `#hud-mute` button is wired to `AudioManager.toggle()` — click toggles mute on/off
- Mute state persists across scenes within a session
- No uncaught Tone.js errors in console during normal play
**notes:** Tone.start() MUST be inside a user gesture handler (keydown, click, touchstart). Wire to the first such event received after game load. AudioManager.init() can be called from Boot.js completion or from WorldScene.create() on the first input.

### TASK-045
**title:** Event listener audit — scene shutdown cleanup + Player.destroy()
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-038]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/entities/Player.js, app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/scenes/ApartmentScene.js, app/game/scenes/ParkScene.js, app/game/scenes/CafeScene.js, app/game/scenes/MarketScene.js, app/game/scenes/StationScene.js, app/game/scenes/PoliceScene.js, app/game/scenes/TestScene.js, app/game/scenes/WorldScene.js]
**writes:** [app/game/entities/Player.js, app/game/scenes/TestScene.js, app/game/scenes/WorldScene.js]
**done_when:**
- `Player.js` has a `destroy()` method that calls `window.removeEventListener` for `joystick:move` and `joystick:stop` using stored bound references
- All interior scenes call `this.player.destroy()` in their `shutdown()` method
- `TestScene.shutdown()` removes `TEST_END` and `TEST_DISMISS` event listeners
- `WorldScene` ZONE_ENTER listener is removed on scene shutdown
- After 5 round-trip World ? ApartmentScene transitions, no duplicate event handlers exist
**notes:** Bind listener functions once in create() as `this._onJoystickMove = (...) => {...}` and reuse the same reference in removeEventListener. Anonymous arrow functions cannot be removed.

---

### TASK-046
**title:** Scene transition guard — prevent double-enter race condition
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-045]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/scenes/WorldScene.js]
**writes:** [app/game/scenes/WorldScene.js]
**done_when:**
- `WorldScene._transitionTo()` sets a boolean lock (`_transitioning = true`) on first call
- Subsequent `_transitionTo()` calls while `_transitioning` is true are silently ignored
- Lock is reset in `WorldScene.shutdown()` (guards against edge cases)
- Multiple overlapping zone collisions do not queue multiple scene transitions
**notes:** Single-file change. Zone overlap is the most common trigger — player standing at a building entrance while walking can fire 2-3 ZONE_ENTER events in one frame.

---

### TASK-047
**title:** NPC relationship tiers — stranger / acquaintance / friend dialogue switching
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-041, TASK-045]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/content/apartment-dialogue.js, app/storage.js, app/config.js]
**writes:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/content/apartment-dialogue.js]
**done_when:**
- `NPC.js` reads `npcRelationships[npcId]` from storage to determine tier: 0 = stranger, 1 = acquaintance, 2 = friend
- Relationship score increments by 1 after each completed dialogue (DIALOGUE_END fires)
- Score thresholds: 0 = stranger, 1–2 = acquaintance, 3+ = friend
- `TutorAI.startConversation()` receives the current tier as context so the system prompt adjusts formality (?? vs ??) per REFERENCE-DIALOGUE.md §1
- Galina's `apartment-dialogue.js` scripted fallbacks have at least two tier-tagged variants per NPC interaction to demonstrate the system working
**notes:** Per REFERENCE-DIALOGUE.md: strangers use ?? and formal address; acquaintances switch to ?? and use the player's name; friends ask questions about the player's life. The tier must be passed to TutorAI so AI-generated responses also respect it.

---

### TASK-048
**title:** Wire MissionGenerator — trigger from dialogue, update HUD + Journal
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-041, TASK-045]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/systems/MissionGenerator.js, app/game/systems/MistakeLogger.js, app/ui/hud.js, app/ui/journal.js, app/storage.js]
**writes:** [app/game/systems/MissionGenerator.js, app/ui/hud.js, app/ui/journal.js]
**done_when:**
- `MissionGenerator.checkAndGenerate()` is called after every `DIALOGUE_END` event
- If a new mission is generated, `#hud-mission` text updates immediately with the mission title
- Journal missions tab re-renders active + completed missions when opened (reads from storage)
- Completed missions display with a visual completion indicator (strikethrough or checkmark)
- Empty state: missions tab shows "??? ???????" when no missions exist
**notes:** MissionGenerator reads from MistakeLogger — ensure MistakeLogger has at least one logged mistake before testing, otherwise no mission will generate.

---

### TASK-049
**title:** Vocabulary logging — dialogue choices feed Journal vocab tab live
**track:** FAST
**status:** IN_PROGRESS
**depends_on:** [TASK-041]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/ui/dialogue.js, app/ui/journal.js, app/game/systems/MistakeLogger.js, app/storage.js, app/config.js]
**writes:** [app/ui/dialogue.js, app/ui/journal.js]
**done_when:**
- When a player selects a dialogue choice, vocabulary words from the current NPC exchange are extracted and saved to storage via `storage.addVocab()`
- Journal vocabulary tab renders all logged words from storage with: Russian word, English translation, scene context (location name)
- Words are deduplicated — the same word appearing twice shows once with a frequency counter
- Journal tab re-reads from storage every time it opens (not cached in memory)
**notes:** Vocabulary extraction can be simple: TutorAI already has the exchange context. Add a `vocab` array to the DIALOGUE_END event payload containing words introduced in that exchange, then persist them. For AI responses, extract from the annotated word list if TutorAI returns one; for scripted fallbacks, attach a static vocab list per script entry.

---

### TASK-050
**title:** Daily NPC conversation limit — one rich exchange per day, then short farewell
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-047]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/systems/TutorAI.js, app/storage.js, app/config.js]
**writes:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/systems/TutorAI.js]
**done_when:**
- Storage tracks `lastTalkedDate[npcId]` — the in-game or real-world date of the last completed conversation
- If player interacts with an NPC they already spoke to today, NPC gives a short contextual farewell line ("?? ??????!" / "See you tomorrow!") and dialogue closes after one beat — no full AI conversation
- System prompt sent to TutorAI includes a `alreadySpokenToday: true` flag when applicable, allowing AI to give a brief response naturally
- Per REFERENCE-GAMEDESIGN.md §1: after one rich conversation, NPC gives "see you tomorrow" — scarcity makes choices feel meaningful
**notes:** "Today" can be defined as the same UTC calendar day, or as a session-based flag if simpler. Start with session-based (reset on page load) then upgrade to date-based.

---

### TASK-051
**title:** NPC interaction indicator — proximity E-key / tap-zone visual
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-045]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/game/entities/Player.js, app/style.css, app/tokens.css]
**writes:** [app/game/entities/NPC.js, app/style.css]
**done_when:**
- When player enters NPC interaction range, a small pixel-art prompt appears above the NPC sprite ("E" on desktop, tap icon on mobile)
- Prompt disappears when player moves out of range or dialogue opens
- Indicator uses pixel font (`--font-hud`) and stone/dark palette matching the game aesthetic
- Works correctly for all NPCs across all scenes
**notes:** Per REFERENCE-GAMEDESIGN.md: the player must know what they can interact with. The indicator should be subtle — not a floating exclamation mark, but a small keyboard hint. Use a Phaser Text object positioned above the NPC sprite, visible only in the interaction zone.

---

### TASK-052
**title:** Mobile dialogue UX — tap to advance, viewport fit, 48px touch targets
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-042]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/ui/dialogue.js, app/style.css, app/tokens.css]
**writes:** [app/ui/dialogue.js, app/style.css]
**done_when:**
- Tapping anywhere on the dialogue text area advances to the next beat (no dedicated "next" button needed)
- Choice buttons are minimum 48px height and full-width on mobile (375px)
- Dialogue panel does not overflow or require horizontal scroll on 375px viewport
- Tap-to-advance does not accidentally trigger NPC interaction again (event propagation handled correctly)
**notes:** Tap-to-advance must be guarded: only fire when dialogue is OPEN state (from TASK-041 state machine). Use a single `click` listener on the dialogue text container, not on the whole window.

---

### TASK-053
**title:** Dialogue API fallback chain — scripted ? AI ? graceful error message
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-041]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/systems/TutorAI.js, app/ui/dialogue.js, app/config.js, app/game/content/apartment-dialogue.js]
**writes:** [app/game/systems/TutorAI.js, app/ui/dialogue.js]
**done_when:**
- If Gemini primary + fallback both fail, TutorAI returns a scripted line from the NPC's location dialogue file (not a generic error string)
- Player can continue the conversation using scripted fallback — no freeze, no empty box
- A subtle in-dialogue indicator shows when AI is unavailable (e.g., a small "(offline)" label near NPC name) — not a disruptive toast
- On API recovery (next interaction), AI mode resumes automatically
**notes:** Current behaviour: silently returns "????????, ? ?????? ?????" with no recovery path. Fix: on API failure, flag TutorAI._offline = true, route subsequent calls through the scripted dialogue arrays, clear flag on next successful API call.

---

### TASK-054
**title:** TestScene lifecycle fix — shutdown cleanup and clean retry flow
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-045]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/scenes/TestScene.js]
**writes:** [app/game/scenes/TestScene.js]
**done_when:**
- `TestScene.shutdown()` removes all `window.addEventListener` calls registered during `create()` (TEST_END, TEST_DISMISS, and any others)
- Player can exit a test and re-enter it without duplicate event handlers accumulating
- Test retry (after failing) works correctly — score resets, questions reload, no stale state
- If test is passed, return to WorldScene with correct unlock state
**notes:** Mirrors TASK-045 pattern. Store bound listener references in this._onTestEnd etc. during create(), remove them in shutdown().

---

### TASK-055
**title:** Loading states + API error toast — boot progress bar, non-blocking error feedback
**track:** FAST
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-038]
**assigned_agents:** [coder, reviewer, git]
**reads:** [app/game/scenes/Boot.js, app/ui/hud.js, app/game/systems/TutorAI.js, app/index.html, app/style.css]
**writes:** [app/game/scenes/Boot.js, app/ui/hud.js, app/style.css]
**done_when:**
- Boot scene displays a pixel-art progress bar while assets load (Phaser `on('progress')` callback)
- When TutorAI API fails (after both retries), a non-blocking toast notification appears for 3 seconds then auto-dismisses
- Toast uses `--font-hud`, stone palette, matches game aesthetic — does not block game interaction
- No raw JS errors visible in browser console during a normal play session
**notes:** Boot progress bar: use Phaser's built-in progress event (`this.load.on('progress', ...)`) to draw a bar in Boot scene graphics. Toast: a single `<div id="hud-toast">` injected into index.html, shown/hidden via CSS class, auto-hidden after 3s via setTimeout.

---

### TASK-040
**title:** Full playtest — end-to-end game loop verification
**track:** BUILD
**status:** BACKLOG
**depends_on:** [TASK-041, TASK-042, TASK-043, TASK-044, TASK-045, TASK-052, TASK-051, TASK-055]
**assigned_agents:** [playtester]
**reads:** [app/index.html, all scene and UI files]
**writes:** [.claude/handoffs/play-report.md]
**done_when:** Playtester completes a full new-player run: onboarding ? apartment ? park ? cafe ? market ? station ? police ? chapter tests ? graduation. play-report.md filed with: (1) any broken interactions, (2) any empty or missing UI, (3) any Russian text errors visible in-game, (4) audio issues, (5) lock/unlock chain verified correct. PASS if no critical blockers found.
**notes:** Test on both desktop keyboard and simulated mobile (375px viewport). Verify dialogue box, journal, HUD, settings all display correctly with the new Kenney fonts and pixel skin.

---

### TASK-IMPROVE-001
**title:** Agent skill improvement — create evals for existing skills, create skills from pipeline patterns
**track:** IMPROVE
**status:** RECURRING
**depends_on:** []
**assigned_agents:** [orchestrator]
**reads:** [.claude/skills/, .claude/agents/, .claude/handoffs/]
**writes:** [.claude/skills/]
**done_when:** Run /improve after every 3 completed BUILD tasks. Each run: (1) review last 3 task outputs for repeated patterns, (2) create or update at least 1 skill, (3) all skill evals pass at 100%.
**notes:** This is a recurring meta-task, not a one-time backlog item. The orchestrator should trigger /improve automatically after TASK-006, TASK-009, TASK-012, TASK-015, TASK-018, TASK-021. Any agent can also request /improve mid-task if they identify an improvement opportunity.
